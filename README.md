The codes used in the following publication: **[Best Paper Award] Barnwal S, and Peng W. Crowdsensing-based WiFi Indoor Localization using Feed-forward Multilayer Perceptron Regressor. In International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Data Science (ICCIDS) 2019 Feb 19. IEEE**

The paper proposes an innovative approach to combine Crowdsensing based wireless indoor localization technology with Artificial Neural Networks. We automatically predict new users location and analyze the effect of device heterogeneity on the RSS localization accuracy, by using cell phone user data. 

The performance evaluation demonstrates that the trained MLP Regression model can obtain the highest localization accuracy than the probabilistic localization algorithms. Moreover, our methodology achieves better accuracy without having individual model for each device in the fingerprinting database, thus, solving the problem of device heterogeneity. 

In contrast with existing systems proposed in the literature, the result shows that our proposed approach efficiently handles very large number of Access Points in 10 times larger indoor spaces.
